#lucos Transport
A web app for keeping track of public transport, particularly on forms of transport where data connections are highly variable.

## Dependancies
* ruby
* [mustache (ruby implementation)](https://github.com/defunkt/mustache)
* [mustache (js implementation)](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js) - currently bundled as a static file in the project
* [lucos core](https://github.com/lucas42/lucos_core)

## Forms of transport currently supported:
* London Underground
* Docklands Light Railway

## Running
The web server is designed to be run within lucos_services, but can be run standalone by running server.rb with ruby.  It currently runs on port 8009.

## Node version
Currently in alpha, there is a node version of the server.  The file to be run is src/index.js
You can also set the following environment variables:
TFLAPPID and TFLAPPKEY - information about TFL's API can be found at https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs
The app appears to run fine without these being set, but registering for an ID and key helps to keep track of which apps are making which requests to the API.
### Setup
To set up the node version run:
```npm install```
```npm run build```
